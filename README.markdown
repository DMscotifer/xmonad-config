# My xmonad-config
My xmonad-config is an [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) configuration based off of the one used by Vic Fryzel.

https://github.com/vicfryzel/xmonad-config

It is configured to not clash with any of my Emacs shortcuts, and provide an integrated experience in Arch Linux.

It works best without a desktop environment, but I have had limited success using it alongside MATE - with light crashes.

mate-panel and caja do not play nice with xmonad and seem to cause most of the crashes.
